    <h1 class="main">For a fully electric future</h1>

    <p> In an all-electric future, charging will be part of driving.
        The same aspirations we have for our vehicles in terms of standards,
        quality and premium experience also apply to charging.
        That's why we want to make the charging experience as easy and convenient as possible for our customers.
        Our goal at Mercedes-Benz is to offer our customers a seamless end-to-end charging experience.
        Starting with the vehicle itself and with all the options our wide range of charging services has to offer.
